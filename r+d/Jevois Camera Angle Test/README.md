# Vision Testing Setup Details

Below are some photos of the overall testing configuration:


## Dimensions

### Test Point Locations

For each test, the camera was located vertically over one of the test points A through F.
These test points are on a 10" x 10" grid with the closest row 35" from the far end
of the alignment line.

### Camera Location

The camera itself was located with its lense 12" above the floor at angle of approximately 30 degrees
pointed forward and downward.  Tests were done using cameras with viewing angles of both 60 and 90
degrees and are noted as such in the associated spreadsheet.

## Test Results

For each test location, a series of permutations was tested:

* 90 degrees to the target (referred to as our 0 degree baseline)
* -30 degrees to the target (robot turned left - counter-clockwise when viewed from above)
* -15 degrees to the target
* +30 degrees to the target (roboto turned right - clockwise when viewed from above)
* +15 degrees to the target

A screen shot from `jevois-inventor` was captured showing the cameras view (with filtered lines highlighted) as well as
console output displaying camera resolution, line start and end locations, line length, and line angle.
